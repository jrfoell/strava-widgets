This plugin never made it to the WordPress.org repository.

I instead joined cmanon's efforts building the wp-strava plugin as a canonical go-to plugin for strava.

You can check out my latest V3 API version here: https://github.com/jrfoell/wp-strava/tree/v3-api
soon to be merged into https://github.com/cmanon/wp-strava and released on WordPress.org
